                <p>Welcome! I'll start off with explaining the name of this site.</p>
                <p>I happen to visit tropical and humid parts of the globe more often 
                than other places in the world. I happen to be something of an expert 
                on travel to tropical environments.</p>
                <p>Naturally my blog is named "Sunset Blog"!</p>
                <p>My name is Andrew Davis but you can call me Andrew.</p>

                <p>Here's the long and short of it.</p>
                <p>
                    I started my traveling hobby on May 23rd, 2009. I left the USA 
                    for a two-month, post-graduation trip to the South Pacific. 
                    The plan was to travel from French Polynesia all the way across 
                    each set islands eastward until arriving at Sydney, Austrialia.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I landed in Papeete, French Polynesia, I had $1200 dollars and nothing else. 
                    I booked a $3 dollar per night dorm room bed in an old hotel in the middle of the city 
                    and just started my adventure from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just kept on going and going from there. I did eventually return home from my trip, but 
                    it's safe to say that I've never stopped traveling since then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm still traveling the world. I take somewhere between 50 to 60 flights per year. 
                    Even though I do have a home to go back to I spend most of my life on the road.
